/**
 * Thinking about changing the crowlib-php SQL folder to IO, renaming SQL classes. Factory, Connection, Data too nondescript.
 * Learned about Symmetric Array Destructuring today on lunch because PHP doesn't support Tuples.
 * Also thinking a bit about just having all the classes in the root of crowlib and saving the folders for functions (preferably pure, I don't want includes in there.)
